SAP Master Data Governance
We can’t afford to go without Data
Governance
Turn data into a competitive advantage that delivers value for
your industry and enterprise.
Success in the digital economy requires a transparent approach to
Master Data to know exactly what your customers want, when they
want it. GRAMONT expertise and accelerators empowers you to
deliver it, creating a single, centralized, up-to-date version of the
truth to drive better decisions, experiences, and outcomes.
GRAMONT provides unique innovations in S/4HANA and ERP as our
Accelerators come with no upgrade and are compatible with your
releases. With Gramont Data Scientist Center Of Excellence you can
easily adopt existing rule mining to discover patterns in existing Master
Data, use mining runs to analyse existing Master Data, which can be
further used in implementations of Data Quality Rules.
Digital transformation
Drive innovation, agility and growth by unlocking the value of your data
across every area of business

https://www.gramont.consulting/expertise/sap-master-data-governance 1/4
Accurate Insight - Fuel every department, system and workflow with
integrated data that increases understanding
Customer experiences
Propel your personalization and deliver unsurpassed experiences using
rich customer profiles
Regulatory Compliance
Harness complete data to boost governance and establish regulatory
controls
Data Quality
Leverage a central repository for collecting, cleansing and enriching data
to develop a golden record
Master Data Governance (MDG)
reliably supports you in keeping your Master Data consistent even in
complex system landscapes that are distributed across various locations.
MDG enables you to adjust your master data quickly to reflect legal
changes, track changes, and respond flexibly to new requirements and
business transactions such as takeovers of other companies.
MDG, Central Governance
provides central ownership of Master Data in line with a company’s
business rules and processes. MDG delivers domain-specific, out-of-the-
box applications as well as a framework for custom-defined Master Data.
MDG offers change request-based processing of Master Data with
integrated workflow, staging, approval, activation and distribution. MDG
can be deployed as a separate hub system or co-deployed with SAP
S/4HANA. In both cases MDG can use SAP and company-specific business
logic to create Master Data ready to be used in a company’s business
processes.
MDG, Consolidation
delivers capabilities to load Master Data from different sources, to
standardize the Master Data and to detect duplicates. MDG,
consolidation calculates a best record from the duplicates in that group
24/09/2024, 20:43 SAP Master Data Governance (MDG) — GRAMONT
https://www.gramont.consulting/expertise/sap-master-data-governance 2/4
based on survivorship rules for the Master Data attributes. You can then
use these best records in dedicated analytical or business scenarios.
Within MDG you can combine consolidation and central governance to
support various Master Data Management scenarios, like initial load of
Master Data as a starting point for central Governance, consolidation of
Master Data after mergers and acquisitions, or combinations where you
keep de-central ownership of Master Data in some parts of the company,
while centralizing Master Data ownership in other parts.
MDG, Mass Processing
enables you to update multiple Master Data records at a time. To update
records, you select the fields and records you want to change. The
system then provides statistics on the changed fields and validates the
Data for business transaction use before activating the changes.
MDG, Data Quality Management
applies your rules to Master Data to detect errors and to trigger their
correction. Rule mining enables you to use machine learning for Data
Analysis and for the creation of Data Quality rules from mined rules.
Process Analytics for Master Data
provides overview pages and analytical list pages, showing relevant
process information for applications in Central Governance,
Consolidation, and Mass Processing.
Machine Learning for Master Data
leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to gather new
insights and elevate your Data Quality. Besides advanced visualizations,
the automated grouping of data, automated rule mining and quality
control, we offer near-duplicate and outlier detection.
Creating better business for a better world with Master Data is the
foundation for any digital transformation. Better business begins with

Overview
Solution Overview
LabelNow is a scalable, cloud-based application on SAP’s Cloud Platform. As part of SAP’s Product Lifecycle
Management (PLM) offering, LabelNow is the next generation SAP standard application for product label
management.
It was developed by years of industry experience and in cooperation with SAP and the Recipe Developments
user community, to deliver the best in breed business application for producing industry labeling needs.
Following the latest SAP FIORI designs, the broadest integration with SAP’s business suites and most secure
business cloud available today for global businesses.
This unmatched offering is deliverable for businesses working with Mono- and Multilanguage labels, facing
Inter-Market Supply scenarios and different regulations around the globe.
Through our development process, Label now was developed with a focus on the end users inside the
company. During repetitive validation and testing of the application design with real end users, LabelNow
has achieved a highly reduced number of clicks (compared to previously existing business application for
label creation), using high level automation and an exclusive ‘Smart Copy’ feature, that allows to re-use
major parts and declarations of a label, while replacing the source object for creation.
Label templates allow definitions of all the necessary process control and output related information per
country, language, product category and permit to achieve a very high level of automation with predefined
ad-hoc or dictionary based phrases and texts or even servings or product preparation skeletons.
Challenges
How can food companies ensure they are providing all relevant product information attributes
(including translation) with speed and accuracy while complying with labeling regulations?
Product labels are the primary method of communicating product information between companies and
their consumers. Consumers rely on accurate food labels to make informed decisions.
During the process of labeling, raw information gets transferred and enriched into legal compliant product
information and adapted to the desired marketing message to create artwork (graphical design) or to be
shared on webpages or data hubs.
Product labeling is an intrinsic part of the product definition process in the food industry. Typically three
solutions / capabilities are required:
- labeling (connected to recipe development & including translation)
- artwork (graphics)
- compliance (local governments and international agencies have created stricter controls in order to
protect consumers and regulate food companies)

Polaris - Driving speed and accuracy into
product submission process
Polaris benefits Life Science companies in a global market with
increasing regulatory challenges
European Medicines Agency (EMA) is in the process of implementing the
standards developed by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) for the identification of medicinal products (IDMP).
These standards specify the use of standardized definitions for the
identification and description of medicinal products for human use. This
facilitates the reliable exchange of medicinal product information in a
robust and consistent manner, by providing a common product
’language’ for stakeholders to use in their interactions. Following the
implementation of the ISO IDMP standards, the agency will replace its
data-submission format in line with the ISO IDMP standards, terminology
and formats.

GRAMONT COMPAS - 360°
Compliance Assessment of Internal
Standards and External Regulations
Creation of a product can be time consuming and costly. But
creating a product without knowing whether it complies with the
internal regulations of the company and external regulations of
the target market can cost even more. The later the compliance
becomes an aspect of the product development, the more cost it
will mean due to work that needs to be redone.
In a world, where the idea to market shall be decreased, where even big
telecommunication-technology companies are „obliged” by the market to
release a brand new version of their equipment or where a food product
on market A shall be introduced on market B in just a matter of few
months, it becomes more and more important to make quick decisions
during product development to be able to go to market as soon as
possible .
Assess and Comply to external
regulations with a few clicks
GRAMONT’s Compas builds upon many years of industry and consumer
experience in the field of PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) with the
intention to deliver a 360° compliance from the supplier of a raw
24/09/2024, 20:45 Compliance Assessment with GRAMONT COMPAS — GRAMONT
https://www.gramont.consulting/products/gramont-compas 1/3
material until the end consumer. Through the complete product design,
from supplier collaboration to product formula design, from physical Bill
of Material (BOMs) to packaging concept design and for Label design
GRAMONT’s Compas gives 360° real time compliance assessment with
reporting and analytical capabilities supporting data-driven decision with
connection to digital product information solutions (e.g.: artwork, data
hubs).
Running an integrated compliance assessment is supported by a user-
friendly interface and user-centric application design. Linked to multiple
objects within your product development, any aspects of your
compliance (internal, external, reconstitution, safety compliance,
supplier, components, etc.) can be defined and checked with ease, while
evaluations can be seen instantly and results can be stored on demand.
Further connected add-ons to Compas – also developed by
GRAMONT – will further optimize costs. The Formula optimization
add-on integrated into SAP PLM Recipe Development can help you
with linear and non-linear problem solving, proposition of
quantities, alternative items even with target driven by cost, carbon
footprint, nutrient or substance content. The integrated Simulation
add-on can evaluate impact of ingredient change in a recipe/recipe
portfolio. Mass change capabilities help to shorten development
time and data maintenance while fast evaluation enables to catch
procurement opportunities on commodities but also on regular
supplier benchmarking exercises.
GRAMONT’s Compas application is a scalable, cloud-based application
built upon SAP’s Cloud Platform which servers as a trusted platform for
businesses around the world. The flexible design of the application also
enables you to connect to compliance data providers of your company’s
choice or select one of the existing integrated providers.

GRAMONT Translation Hub (GTH) simplifies multilingual
translations for global applications and offers content for
software development related translations by applying lessons of
machine learning.
Challenges
﻿ Industry and Customer specific translations need to be in line with
Government regulations. The challenges are a lack of integration for any
kind of translation automation in Legacy Software. Translating business
objects requires a high amount of manual labor and there are no Plug

3rd party suppliers. Building centralized Translation libraries is a
complex process and the validation process for Translations in Corporate
Translation Hubs is a time consuming effort.

Recipe formulas can be adapted on the fly with integrated calculations
showing detailed ingredients, nutrients and thresholds information.
The calculations for the scoring systems are implemented in SAP PLM
Specification, Recipe and LabelNow Cloud Solution. The available scoring
systems are easily adjustable to regulation changes thanks to the use of
a generic framework. They can also be easily extended to additional
nutritional or environment schemes. The Scoring Suite serves as a
guideline and support for companies that aim to improve their scores

Nutri-Score
The Nutri-Score is an easily
understandable front-of-pack
nutritional rating system for food
and beverages introduced by the
European Union. It is officially
recommended by the World
Health Organization and health authorities in France, Germany, Belgium,
Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Spain.
The code consists of 5 colors, each with its own letter (A to E) which
enables the consumer to get an overview of the nutritional value of the
product. In addition, it allows a quick nutritionally meaningful
comparison of foods within a product group, as a food with a green A
rating is more likely to contribute to a healthy diet than a product with a
red E.
Nutri-Score calculation is based on information companies already use
for the creation of nutritional value tables and ingredient lists of their
products. Nutri-Score itself is based on comprehensive, transparent,
independent scientific approach developed following a large concertation
with a large number of stakeholders (industry, retailers, consumers,
scientists).
UK Traffic Light nutritional rating

https://www.gramont.consulting/products/nutri-score-traffic-light-in-sap-plm-recipe-development 2/4
The Traffic Light is an informative
nutritional rating system
developed by the Food Standards
Agency (FSA) placed on pre-
packaged food and drinks used
mainly in the UK and Ireland.
The color coding gives the consumer a quick overview of the nutritional
information and helps them to make a healthy choice by comparing
products quickly. The Traffic Light gives the amount of energy per serving
and shows whether a product is high (red), medium (amber) or low
(green) in fat, saturated fat, sugars and salt. Nutrients with “green”
indicators are healthier and to be preferred over those with “red”
indicators. Additionally, it provides information about the reference
intakes per serving.
Eco-Score
The Eco-Score rates the
environmental impact of a
product from the production to
the consumption. The
Classification of products are color
coded according to their impact on the environment: from a green A
(low) to a red E (high). Depending on environmental impact a score of up
to 100 is given.
The scoring is evaluated on two components: The Life Cycle Assessment
(LCA) based on the French database Agribalyse with information on the
impact of production, transport, manufacturing, packaging of food on
the environment. Additional quality criteria, such as recyclability, and
origin of ingredients (regionality and seasonality) are also considered.
Get in Contact with our PLM Consultants and find out how you can
calculate the Nutri-Score, Eco-Score or UK Traffic Light nutritional
rating systems and other advance features directly within SAP PLM.

Implementation of SAP PLM RD as Update to the existing SAP RM
2020
The Customer
Zott SE & Co. KG is a traditional Bavarian family-owned
dairy company, producing a variety of yoghurts, desserts
and cheese specialties. Their products are available in
numerous countries around the world. With a net
turnover of 935 million EUR and 898 million liters of
processed milk in 2020 and about 2,800 employees at
present, Zott is amongst the leading dairies in Europe.
Business Needs
Zott is using SAP software for different business needs
since 2007. As part of the digital transformation which
leads to an S/4 HANA database usage, a migration from
the existing Recipe Management module to SAP Recipe
Development had to be implemented.
The Challenge
The introduction of the new S/4 HANA generation at Zott
induced a complete revamp of the group-wide existing
R&D landscape. Facing the additional challenges of the
Corona pandemic, this ambitious plan was realized by
the collaborating teams of GRAMONT Germany, the Zott
IT department and Zott R&D experts within planned time
and budget.

The Solution
GRAMONT implemented SAP PLM with special focus on
processes in Recipe Development and a successful data
conversion and migration. Therefore, all recipe related
data had to be converted to a format which is satisfying
the requirements of the HANA database structures.
Normally, introducing the new technology in Zott’s
process landscape, which had been growing over the
past 13 years, would take three years. Due to the
pressure placed on this transformation, and the
necessity of creating a new technical platform for further
optimizations, the goal was to complete the introduction
in only 12 months by handling many different parts of
the project in parallel.
“We succeeded because everyone managing the
different interfaces supported us by giving our RD
project priority” says Zott’s Department Manager
of Fruit Product Development.
Now that Zott has a forward-thinking system ready
for all of the company projects, they will require IT
support in the coming years. We at GRAMONT are
proud to be part of that journey.
